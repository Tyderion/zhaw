    Exercise 8
    Eve can just send the message over and over again and the bank will transfer 1000 chf to her every time
    
    Remedy:
    We could include a random identifier in the payload (encrypted with the banks public key) with which the bank 
    could track if a transaction has been done before. or just a timestamp.
